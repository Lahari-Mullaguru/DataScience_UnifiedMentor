# Life Expectancy Analysis

## Overview
A regression-based analysis using WHO and UN data (2000â€“2015) across 193 countries to explore health, economic, and lifestyle factors impacting life expectancy.

## Objectives
- Identify key predictors of life expectancy.
- Assess the role of healthcare, education, and immunization.

## Workflow
- **Dataset**: WHO Global Health Observatory & UN data.
- **EDA**: Missing value handling, outlier removal, variable correlation.
- **Models**: OLS regression, feature selection with VIF and p-values.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Impact of healthcare spending
  - Mortality rates and life expectancy
  - Role of education, alcohol, immunization

## Key Insights
- Education and healthcare spending strongly improve life expectancy.
- HIV/AIDS and high adult/infant mortality reduce lifespan.
- Schooling and immunization show positive correlations.

## Tools
`Python`, `Pandas`, `Statsmodels`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
